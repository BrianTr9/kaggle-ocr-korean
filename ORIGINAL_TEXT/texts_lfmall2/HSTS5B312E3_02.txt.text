The first time I saw her, she was standing on the platform at the train
station. She was wearing a long, dark coat and a hat that obscured
her face. I couldn't see her eyes, but I could tell that she was beautiful.
I was drawn to her immediately. I don't know why. There was
something about her that was both mysterious and inviting.
I watched her for a few minutes, and then I knew that I had to speak
to her. I walked over to her and introduced myself. She smiled shyly
and told me her name was Sarah. We talked for a while, and I found
that she was just as beautiful on the inside as she was on the outside.
We exchanged numbers, and we started dating a few weeks later.
We fell in love quickly, and we got married a year later.
We've been married for ten years now, and I still love her more
than the day I met her. She's my best friend, my soulmate, and the
love of my life.

Chapter Three

The wind whispers through the trees,
A gentle, mournful sound.
The leaves, they dance upon the breeze,
And fall upon the ground.

The sun, it sets in fiery red,
A final, fleeting gleam.
The day is done, the light has fled,
And all is but a dream.

But in the darkness, there is hope,
A glimmer of a star.
And though the night may seem to cope,
The dawn is never far.
